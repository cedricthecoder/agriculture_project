### Project Title: Emissions from Energy Use in Agriculture

This project aims to analyze greenhouse gas emissions resulting from energy use in the agricultural sector. By exploring historical emission values across different regions and time periods, the project will uncover patterns, identify key emission sources, and assess trends.

The analysis will include:
- Identifying the highest emitting countries or regions,
- Tracking emission trends over time,
- Visualizing emission distributions, and
- Detecting anomalies or peak periods.

The project will also build a predictive model to forecast future emission values based on historical data. These insights will support efforts to promote energy efficiency and reduce environmental impacts in agriculture.
